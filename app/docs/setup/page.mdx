## Multi-Channel Setup

You can use multiple channels simultaneously for redundancy:
```yaml filename=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
- name: Notify all channels
  if: always()
  uses: michaelikoko/workflow-blabber@v1
  with:
    channels: 'email,discord,telegram,slack'
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    # Add credentials for each channel...
```

**Tip:** Start with one channel, then add more as needed. Each channel operates independently—if one fails, others still receive notifications.
