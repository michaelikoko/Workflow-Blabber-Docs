# Multiple Jobs

Coordinate notifications across multiple jobs in your workflow. Send a single consolidated notification after all jobs complete, or notify at each stage.

## Notify Based on Specific Job Status
Check the result of a specific job:
```yaml filename=".github/workflows/ci.yml" {32}
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
  
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
  
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    if: success()
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        run: ./deploy.sh
  
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build, test, deploy]
    if: always()
    steps:
      - name: Notify based on deployment
        uses: michaelikoko/workflow-blabber@v1
        with:
          channels: 'slack'
          status: ${{ needs.deploy.result }}  # Use deploy job status
          slack_webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## Notify Only on Any Failure
```yaml filename=".github/workflows/ci.yml" {18}
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
  
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
  
  notify-failure:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build, test]
    if: failure()  # Only runs if any job failed
    steps:
      - name: Alert on failure
        uses: michaelikoko/workflow-blabber@v1
        with:
          channels: 'email,telegram'
          status: 'failure'
          custom_message: 'Pipeline failed - check workflow logs'
          smtp_host: 'smtp.gmail.com'
          smtp_port: '587'
          smtp_user: ${{ secrets.SMTP_USER }}
          smtp_password: ${{ secrets.SMTP_PASSWORD }}
          recipient_email: ${{ secrets.RECIPIENT_EMAIL }}
          telegram_bot_token: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN }}
          telegram_chat_id: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID }}
```

## Parallel Jobs with Consolidated Notification
Multiple independent jobs with one final notification:
```yaml filename=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
  
  unit-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Unit tests
        run: npm run test:unit
  
  integration-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration
  
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Security scan
        run: npm audit
  
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, unit-tests, integration-tests, security-scan]
    if: always()
    steps:
      - name: Pipeline complete
        uses: michaelikoko/workflow-blabber@v1
        with:
          channels: 'slack'
          status: ${{ job.status }}
          custom_title: 'CI Pipeline Complete'
          custom_message: 'All checks completed'
          slack_webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## Job Status Reference
Access job results using the `needs` context:
```yaml
# Single job status
status: ${{ needs.build.result }}

# Current job status
status: ${{ job.status }}
```

Possible values:
- `success` - Job completed successfully
- `failure` - Job failed
- `cancelled` - Job was cancelled
- `skipped` - Job was skipped
